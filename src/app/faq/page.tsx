  {
    question: 'How does CRWLR work?',
    answer:

  {
    question: "How accurate is CRWLR's analysis?",
    answer:
      'While our AI-powered analysis is highly sophisticated, it should not be considered legal advice. We strive for accuracy, but recommend consulting with a legal professional for critical matters. Our system is continuously improving based on user feedback and expert review.',

    question: 'Can I use CRWLR for my business?',

  },
  {
    question: 'How does CRWLR calculate privacy scores?',
    answer:
      'Our privacy scores are based on multiple factors including data collection practices, sharing with third parties, user control over data, retention policies, and compliance with privacy regulations. Higher scores indicate more user-friendly and privacy-respecting terms.',
  },
  {
    question: "What are 'red flags' in CRWLR's analysis?",
    answer:
      'Red flags highlight potentially concerning clauses in legal documents. These might include broad rights to user content, mandatory arbitration clauses, significant limitations on liability, unilateral terms changes without notice, or extensive data collection practices.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to create an account to use CRWLR?',
    answer:
      'No, you can perform basic searches without creating an account. However, creating a free account allows you to save your search history, receive alerts about changes to services you use, and access additional features.',
